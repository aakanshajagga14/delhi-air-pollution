# Delhi Ward Pollution Action Dashboard

A ward-wise, action-oriented air pollution intelligence dashboard designed for
municipal officers and policymakers to enable rapid, localized intervention.

## Problem
Delhi’s air pollution monitoring is city-level, reactive, and fragmented.
Ward officers lack localized insights to identify hotspots, sources, and
priority actions in real time.

- Ward-level intelligence
- Pollution source interpretation
- Clear, department-mapped action recommendations

## Key Features
- Ward-wise AQI visualization
- Pollution severity color coding
- GIS-based pollution heatmap
- Trend analysis using interactive charts
- Rule-based, explainable recommendations

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Apache ECharts
- Leaflet.js
- JSON-based mock datasets

## Architecture
Public AQI Data → Processing → Analytics → Visualization → Actionable Output

## Scalability
- Can integrate CPCB / DPCC APIs
- Expandable to other Indian cities
- No new hardware required
